### 3. Common Review Comments

#### Architecture Issues
```markdown
🏗️ **Architecture Concern**
This logic belongs in the domain layer, not the controller. 
Consider moving it to a use case or domain service.

🔄 **Dependency Direction**
The domain layer shouldn't depend on infrastructure. 
Consider using dependency inversion here.

📦 **Single Responsibility**
This class is doing too many things. Consider splitting 
it into separate, focused classes.
```

#### Security Issues
```markdown
🔐 **Security Risk**
User input should be validated before processing. 
Consider using a validation schema here.

🛡️ **Authorization Missing**
This endpoint needs authorization. Add role-based 
access control before the business logic.

🔒 **Sensitive Data**
This logs sensitive information. Consider masking 
PII data in logs.
```

#### Performance Issues
```markdown
⚡ **Performance Concern**
This could cause N+1 queries. Consider using 
eager loading or a single query with joins.

🏃 **Optimization Opportunity**
This operation could benefit from caching. 
Consider adding Redis cache here.

💾 **Memory Usage**
Loading all records into memory could cause issues 
with large datasets. Consider pagination or streaming.
```

#### Code Quality Issues
```markdown
📖 **Readability**
This function is complex and hard to understand. 
Consider breaking it into smaller functions.

🏷️ **Naming**
The variable name 'data' is too generic. 
Consider a more descriptive name like 'userProfile'.

🧪 **Testing**
This business logic isn't covered by tests. 
Please add unit tests for the happy path and error cases.
```
