# User Story 1.2 Implementation Summary

**Story:** API Gateway Configuration - Kong API Gateway with rate limiting & auth  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Assignee:** Backend Developer  
**Points:** 5  

---

## üéØ Implementation Details

### What Was Completed

#### 1. Enhanced Kong Gateway Configuration
**File:** `infrastructure/docker/kong/kong.yml`

- ‚úÖ **JWT Authentication Middleware**
  - Configured JWT plugin for protected routes
  - Set up consumers for users and partners
  - Added claim verification (exp, iss, role, partner_id)

- ‚úÖ **Differentiated Rate Limiting**
  - Users: 100 requests/minute (as per requirements)
  - Partners: 1000 requests/minute (as per requirements)
  - Admin: 200 requests/minute (reasonable for admin operations)
  - Public endpoints: Lower limits for security

- ‚úÖ **Load Balancing Configuration**
  - Configured upstreams for all services
  - Added active and passive health checks
  - Round-robin algorithm with health monitoring
  - Production-ready failover mechanisms

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Routing**
  - Separated public vs protected routes
  - Service-specific rate limiting
  - Health check endpoints for monitoring

#### 2. Monitoring Integration
**Files:** 
- `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/datasources.yml` (new)
- `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dashboard.yml` (new)
- `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/kong-gateway.json` (new)

- ‚úÖ **Prometheus Integration**
  - Added Kong prometheus plugin
  - Configured metrics collection
  - Added Kong metrics to existing Prometheus scraping

- ‚úÖ **Grafana Dashboard**
  - Created Kong Gateway dashboard
  - Request rate monitoring
  - Response latency tracking
  - Success rate monitoring

#### 3. Documentation & Testing
**Files:**
- `infrastructure/docker/kong/README.md` (new)
- `infrastructure/docker/kong/test-gateway.sh` (new)

- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Complete Kong configuration guide
  - Usage instructions for developers
  - Security and production considerations

- ‚úÖ **Testing Scripts**
  - Validation script for all acceptance criteria
  - Endpoint testing utilities

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criteria | Status | Implementation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| All microservices accessible through single gateway endpoint | ‚úÖ DONE | Kong proxy at port 8000 routes to all services |
| Rate limiting enforced (100 req/min users, 1000 req/min partners) | ‚úÖ DONE | Differentiated rate limiting per user type |
| JWT authentication validates successfully | ‚úÖ DONE | JWT plugin configured with proper claims validation |
| Requests properly routed to correct services | ‚úÖ DONE | Service-specific routes with load balancing |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### Authentication
- **JWT-based authentication** for all protected routes
- **Public routes** for registration and catalog browsing
- **Role-based claims** for admin and partner access

### Rate Limiting
- **Tiered rate limiting** based on user type
- **Endpoint-specific limits** for different operations
- **DDoS protection** with reasonable limits

### CORS Policy
- **Cross-origin support** for frontend applications
- **Secure headers** and credential handling
- **Development-friendly** configuration

---

## üìä Monitoring Capabilities

### Kong Metrics Available
- Request rate per service
- Response latency percentiles
- HTTP status code distribution
- Consumer usage patterns
- Upstream health status

### Grafana Dashboard
- **Real-time monitoring** of gateway performance
- **Visual alerts** for performance issues
- **Historical data** for capacity planning

---

## üöÄ Production Readiness

### Load Balancing
- **Health checks** for all upstream services
- **Automatic failover** when services are unhealthy
- **Round-robin distribution** for optimal performance

### Scalability
- **Upstream configuration** ready for multiple instances
- **Redis-based rate limiting** can be enabled for distributed deployment
- **Horizontal scaling** support built-in

## üîß Developer Usage

### Testing the Gateway
```bash
# Run the test script
./infrastructure/docker/kong/test-gateway.sh

# Start services
docker compose up

# Access gateway
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rewards/catalog  # Public
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/profile     # Protected
```

### Monitoring
- **Kong Admin**: http://localhost:8001
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090  
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
