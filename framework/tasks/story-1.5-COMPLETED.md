## ðŸ”§ Developer Usage

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Pipeline triggers automatically on:
# - Push to main/develop branches
# - Pull requests to main/develop

# Manual workflow dispatch available from GitHub Actions tab
# Pipeline includes:
# 1. Parallel testing for all services
# 2. Security scanning with OWASP
# 3. Docker image builds and pushes
# 4. Environment deployments
```

### Infrastructure Deployment
```bash
# Deploy infrastructure with Terraform
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var="environment=dev"
terraform apply -var="environment=dev"

# Deploy applications with Kubernetes
cd infrastructure/kubernetes
kubectl apply -f base/
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Migrations run automatically on application startup
# Manual migration (if needed):
cd services/user-service
mvn flyway:migrate

# Migration status
mvn flyway:info
```
