## 🎯 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Months 1-3) ⭐ CRITICAL
- **Core Services:** User, Point, Rewards, Admin services
- **Infrastructure:** Database, messaging, API gateway
- **Security:** Authentication, authorization, data protection

### Phase 2 - Enhancement (Months 4-6) 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Advanced Features:** Tiered membership, enhanced catalog, transaction history
- **Performance:** Caching, optimization, monitoring
- **Integration:** External services, payment gateways

### Phase 3 - Advanced (Months 7-9) 📊 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Analytics:** Reporting dashboard, business intelligence
- **Ecosystem:** Partner integration, mobile support
- **Optimization:** Performance tuning, advanced features
